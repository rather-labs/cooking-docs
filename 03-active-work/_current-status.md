# Project Status Report

**Report Date:** October 22, 2025
**Reporting Period:** Post-Beta Launch (October 17-22, 2025)
**Overall Status:** 🟢 Green - Beta Launch Successful

## Executive Summary

Cooking.gg successfully executed its closed beta launch on **October 17, 2025** after an intensive 6-month development sprint from May-October 2025. The platform achieved **99.9% uptime** during the first four days of beta operation with stable **3-second transaction completion** times (down from 5-6 seconds in early October).

Internal testing phase began **October 21** with 5 client team members. If no catastrophic issues are discovered during this week, full closed beta launch with **30-40 whitelist users** will commence **October 27, 2025** using a referral-only access model designed for viral growth.

The team successfully resolved critical performance crises in October 2025, including ClickHouse merge saturation (1,000+ stuck queries) and Solana transaction byte limit issues (50% failure rate). Platform now demonstrating production-ready stability with comprehensive monitoring, auto-scaling infrastructure, and multi-chain trading capabilities (Solana meme coins + Hyperliquid perpetuals).

### Significant Decisions Made (October 17-22):

**Cookie-Based Authentication with Next.js Proxy** (October 22, 2025)
- Moved from header-based to cookie-based authentication for XSS protection
- Implemented Next.js proxy for cross-domain cookie complexity
- Set cookies for all *.cooking.gg subdomains (Secure + HttpOnly flags)
- Backend supports dual auth during transition period
- Addresses AWS 60-second timeout complexity for multi-service architecture

**Knowledge Base Centralization with Claude AI** (October 22, 2025)
- Established Git-based documentation repository with 101+ meeting notes
- Claude AI indexing enables instant knowledge queries
- Organized by foundation, decisions, active work, knowledge base, meetings
- Dramatically improves onboarding and decision context preservation
- Addresses information loss when team members transition

**Fee Division Implementation Paused** (October 22, 2025)
- Deferred two-transaction fee approach due to complexity concerns

- Maintains single transaction flow for users
- Avoids major fee calculation logic refactoring

**Working Guards On-Call Rotation** (October 20, 2025)
- Proposed 7-day rotation with base fee + hourly charges
- Base fee covers availability, hourly rate covers actual off-hours work
- Critical for 24/7 beta user support once 30-40 users active
- Status: Proposed (ADR-303), awaiting client approval

**[ADR-100: Jupiter as Primary Router](../02-decisions/ADR-100-jupiter-primary-router-eco-rejection.md)** (October 15, 2025)
- Rejected client-requested Eco router due to architectural incompatibility

- Final execution: October 17, 2025 (revised during planning)
- "Actual product" not MVP requirement drove timeline
- Successfully delivered with 99.9% uptime in first week

**[ADR-502: ClickHouse Two-Client Architecture](../02-decisions/2025-10-06-clickhouse-two-client-architecture.md)** (October 6, 2025)
- Resolved critical performance crisis (1,000+ pending queries)
- API queries prioritized over background cron jobs
- Zero infrastructure cost increase
- API query p95 latency < 1 second (down from 12-14 seconds)

### Important Discoveries:

**Solana Byte Limit Crisis (Resolved)**
- 50% transaction failure rate from Jupiter + fees + referral transfers
- Temporary fix: Disabled fee collection to make transactions work
- Martin implemented iterative max hops reduction to fit byte limit
- Long-term solution: Separate linked transaction for fee collection (planned)

## Active Blockers

### Minor Production Issues (Non-Blocking):

**1. CORS Configuration for Cookie Authentication**
**Status:** 🟡 In Progress (October 22)
**Impact:** Production batch operations affected, but not blocking launch
**Owner:** Esteban Restrepo
**Resolution:** Use shared CORS utility from backend service (immediate priority)
**Context:** Transaction service configured with wildcard CORS, incompatible with cookie-based authentication

**2. Custom Order Form Validation Bug**
**Status:** 🟡 In Progress (October 22)
**Impact:** Users cannot save time-based fields in custom orders (Average Holding Time, Price Change)
**Owner:** Germán Derbes Catoni / Marko Jauregui
**Resolution:** Add default values to time-based fields
**Root Cause:** Fields without defaults fail validation, only activate when time unit changed

### Recently Resolved (October 17-22):
- ClickHouse merge saturation → Two-client architecture (ADR-502) ✅
- Transaction byte limit → Iterative max hops reduction ✅
- Refresh token cookies → Axios to Fetch migration ✅
- DNS management → Screen-share workshop completed ✅
- Eco integration pressure → Demonstrated competitive performance ✅
- React key property bug → Carousel deduplication fixed ✅
