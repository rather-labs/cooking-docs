# Blockers and Risks

**Last Updated:** October 22, 2025
**Project Phase:** Post-Beta Launch (Internal Testing)

---

## Active Blockers

**Current Status:** ðŸŸ¡ Minor Issues (Non-Blocking)

### Production Issues Identified October 22:

#### Issue 1: CORS Configuration for Cookie Authentication
**Blocked Since:** October 22, 2025
**Impact:** Medium - Production batch operations affected
**Severity:** Non-blocking (workaround available)
**Owner:** Esteban Restrepo
**Description:**
- Transaction service configured with wildcard CORS
- Incompatible with cookie-based authentication (requires exact origins)
- Affects batch operations in dev and production

**Mitigation:**
- Use shared CORS utility from backend service (immediate)
- Duplicate proper CORS setup to transaction service
- Priority: Same day resolution

**Status:** ðŸŸ¡ In Progress (fixes being deployed)

---

#### Issue 2: Custom Order Form Validation Bug
**Blocked Since:** October 22, 2025 (Production)
**Impact:** High - Users cannot create custom orders with time-based fields
**Severity:** Production critical
**Owner:** GermÃ¡n Derbes Catoni / Marko Jauregui
**Description:**
- Average Holding Time and Price Change fields don't save values
- Fields with time frame references fail validation
- Only activates when time unit manually changed (minutes â†’ hours)

**Root Cause:**
- Fields lack default/initial state values
- Changing time frame selector triggers proper state update
- Should have pre-selected default values

**Mitigation:**
- Add default values to all time-based custom order fields
- Priority: Same day fix

**Status:** ðŸŸ¡ In Progress (assigned to GermÃ¡n/Marko)

---

#### Issue 3: React Key Property Missing in Iterations
**Resolved:** October 22, 2025
**Impact:** High - Production carousel breakage
**Description:**
- Missing `key` property in `.map()` iterations caused carousel deduplication
- Showed only one item instead of all items
- Bug appeared in production but not local development
- Affected home carousel and positions carousel

**Resolution:** âœ… Immediate hotfix deployed with keys added to all iterations
**Lesson:** Always use `key` property in React iterations, even for Fragments

## Active Risks

### High-Priority Risks

#### Risk 1: Internal Testing Uncovers Catastrophic Bug
**Risk Score:** ðŸŸ¡ Medium
**Probability:** Medium (20-30%) | **Impact:** High
**Owner:** Lucas CufrÃ© + Team

**Description:**
5 client users testing October 21-27. Risk of discovering critical bug preventing October 27 full closed beta launch.

**Trigger Events:**
- Transaction failure rate > 5%
- Data loss or security incident
- Critical UX blocker preventing core workflows

**Impact if Realized:**
- Delay October 27 launch by 1-4 weeks
- Damages client confidence
- Further delays revenue generation

**Mitigation:**
- âœ… Extensive pre-launch testing completed
- âœ… Comprehensive monitoring (CloudWatch, SNS alerts)
- âœ… Rapid response team on standby
- [ ] Documented rollback procedures

**Contingency:**
- Minor: Fix rapidly, continue testing
- Moderate: Extend testing 3-5 days
- Critical: Delay October 27, transparent communication
- Catastrophic: Roll back, full architecture review

---

#### Risk 2: ClickHouse Knowledge Centralization
**Risk Score:** ðŸŸ¡ Medium
**Probability:** Low (15-20%) | **Impact:** High
**Owner:** Lucas CufrÃ© + Eduardo Yuschuk + DarÃ­o Balmaceda

**Description:**
Eduardo single expert on ClickHouse. If unavailable, performance could degrade without optimization expertise.

**Impact if Realized:**
- Query latency could return to 12-14s
- Slower incident response
- Development velocity reduced

**Mitigation:**
- âœ… DarÃ­o partnership (October 2025)
- âœ… Repository documentation for all changes
- [ ] Knowledge sharing sessions
- [ ] Runbook documentation
- [ ] External consultant relationship

**Progress:** ðŸŸ¢ Improving (DarÃ­o reducing single-point-of-failure)

---

### Medium-Priority Risks

#### Risk 3: Transaction Fee Collection Architecture Delayed
**Risk Score:** ðŸŸ¡ Medium
**Probability:** Medium (30-40%) | **Impact:** Medium
**Owner:** Martin Aranda + Esteban Restrepo

**Description:**
Linked transaction implementation could exceed Q4 timeline, further delaying revenue generation.

**Mitigation:**
- Q4 priority status ensures focused time
- Martin + Esteban collaboration
- Phased approach: Basic fees first, referral distribution second

**Contingency:**
- Accept Q1 2026 timeline if needed
- Simplified fee collection as interim solution

---

#### Risk 4: Apple App Store Review Rejection
**Risk Score:** ðŸŸ¡ Medium
**Probability:** Medium (25-35%) | **Impact:** Medium
**Owner:** Byron Chavarria + Lucas CufrÃ©

**Description:**
Mobile app could be rejected, delaying iOS launch.

**Mitigation:**
- âœ… Account deletion implemented
- âœ… Biometric authentication (ADR-401)
- âœ… Security password (ADR-400)
- [ ] GitBook help documentation (Lucas)
- [ ] TestFlight extensive testing

**Contingency:**
- Address rejection feedback (1-2 week turnaround)
- Fall back to web app during review

---

#### Risk 5: Provider-Discriminated Pricing Requires Major Restructuring
**Risk Score:** ðŸŸ¡ Medium
**Probability:** Medium (40-50%) | **Impact:** Medium
**Owner:** Eduardo Yuschuk + Client

**Description:**
Competitive platforms show provider-specific pricing. Addressing this may require major indexer restructuring.

**Eduardo's Assessment:**
> "To compete, you have to index this. I don't see a path for the application if we don't eventually index that."

**Decision Required:**
Client must choose: Accept current model or commit to Q1 2026 restructuring

**Mitigation:**
- Short-term: Improved price filtering (Eduardo implementing)
- Medium-term: Provider discrimination via Jupiter API
- Long-term: Full pool indexing (Q1 2026+)
