# BSC Integration Report

## Executive Summary

This report outlines the implementation strategy and estimation for adding Binance Smart Chain (BSC) support to the Cooking trading platform. Based on our current Solana-based architecture and existing EVM integration through Hyperliquid, we can leverage our existing infrastructure to efficiently add BSC support.

## Current Architecture Analysis

### Existing Indexer Infrastructure

Our current indexer architecture includes:

1. **Solana-based Microindexers**: Protocol-specific indexers (Raydium, Pump.fun, Jupiter, Orca, etc.)
2. **Microservices Architecture**: Backend organized by trading algorithm type (DCA, limit orders, perpetuals)
3. **Data Storage**:
   - ClickHouse for time-series trading data (15x query performance improvement)
   - Redis for raw Solana blockchain JSON blocks
4. **Event Queue**: Kafka for buffering between microindexers and database
5. **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket to SSE migration architecture
6. **Wallet Management**: Turnkey for both Solana and EVM chains

### Existing EVM Support

We already have EVM support through:

- **Hyperliquid Integration**: Arbitrum-based perpetuals trading
- **Turnkey Wallet Management**: Already supports EVM chains
- **Cross-chain Architecture**: Designed for multi-chain support

## BSC Integration Strategy

### Option 1: Ponder.sh Framework (Recommended)

**Overview**: Ponder.sh is a modern EVM indexing framework designed for building high-performance blockchain data services.

**Advantages**:

- Rapid development with built-in EVM compatibility
- Automatic GraphQL API generation
- Optimized for EVM chains (including BSC)
- Built-in caching and performance optimizations
- TypeScript-first approach matching our stack

**Implementation Approach**:

1. Create BSC-specific Ponder configuration
2. Define schema for BSC trading protocols
3. Implement event handlers for major DEXs (PancakeSwap, etc.)
4. Integrate with a ClickHouse database

**Estimated Timeline**: 4 weeks

- Week 1: Ponder setup and BSC configuration
- Week 2-3: Schema design and event handler implementation
- Week 3-4: Integration with existing infrastructure and testing

### Option 2: Custom Indexer (Alternative)

**Overview**: Build a custom BSC indexer following our Solana indexer pattern.

**Advantages**:

- Full control over implementation
- Consistent with existing architecture
- Optimized for our specific use cases
- Probably better performance

**Implementation Approach**:

1. Create BSC RPC client
2. Implement block and transaction processing
3. Build event filtering and parsing
4. Integrate with existing data pipeline
5. Connect to ClickHouse and Redis

**Estimated Timeline**: 8-10 weeks

- Week 1-3: BSC RPC client and basic block processing
- Week 4-6: Event filtering and parsing implementation
- Week 7-8: Data pipeline integration
- Week 9-10: Testing and optimization

### Integration with Existing Infrastructure

1. **Database Integration**:

   - Extend existing ClickHouse tables with chain identifier
   - Add BSC-specific partitioning strategy
   - Leverage existing time-series optimizations

## Resource Requirements

### Development Team

- **Backend Developer**: 1 FTE (4 weeks for Ponder, 8-10 weeks for custom)
- **Frontend Developer**: 1 FTE (4 weeks)
- **DevOps Engineer**: 0.5 FTE (infrastructure setup and deployment)
- **QA Engineer**: 0.5 FTE (testing and validation)

### Infrastructure

- **Additional RPC Endpoints**: BSC requires multiple RPC providers for reliability
- **Increased Storage**: Estimate 20-30% increase in data storage
- **Additional Compute**: 15-25% increase in processing capacity
- **Monitoring**: Enhanced monitoring for multi-chain performance

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks

1. **RPC Rate Limiting**: BSC endpoints may have different rate limits
   - Mitigation: Multiple RPC providers with fallback logic
2. **Data Volume**: BSC has high transaction volume
   - Mitigation: Efficient filtering and batching strategies
3. **Chain-specific Issues**: BSC may have unique characteristics
   - Mitigation: Thorough testing on testnet first

### Business Risks

1. **Timeline**: Integration may take longer than estimated
   - Mitigation: Start with MVP approach and iterate
2. **Resource Requirements**: May require more infrastructure than planned
   - Mitigation: Phased rollout with monitoring

## Recommendations

1. **Adopt Ponder.sh Framework**: Faster development, lower cost, proven EVM compatibility
2. **Leverage Existing Infrastructure**: Maximize reuse of current systems
3. **Implement Phased Rollout**: Start with MVP, expand based on user feedback

## Success Metrics

1. **Technical Metrics**:

   - Indexing latency < 5 seconds
   - API response time < 200ms
   - 99.9% uptime
   - Zero data loss

2. **Business Metrics**:
   - User adoption of BSC features
   - Trading volume on BSC pairs
   - Cross-chain arbitrage opportunities
   - User satisfaction scores
