# Weekly Demo - July 4, 2025

**Date:** 2025-07-04
**Time:** Not specified
**Attendees:** RatherLabs Development Team, Cooking Team
**Facilitator:** Not specified

## Executive Summary

This week marked substantial progress across all development tracks with particular emphasis on HyperLiquid integration and mobile development initialization. The backend team successfully tested critical components of the HyperLiquid ecosystem including SOL deposit flows, core service integrations, and Turnkey integration for secure wallet generation and authentication. Significant database migration work continued with four major tables (Transfers, Holders, Traders, Wallets) successfully migrated to the new Clickhouse server, improving query performance and scalability.

The indexer team completed a major milestone by finishing the indexing of Jupiter Supported Tokens, expanding the platform's trading capabilities. They also collaborated closely with the backend team on Clickhouse optimization and configuration. Frontend development made substantial progress in standardizing UI components with skeleton loaders deployed across multiple screens and new component systems for tooltips, colors, icons, and links under testing. These standardization efforts ensure consistent user experience across the platform.

Mobile development officially kicked off with initial infrastructure and native components completed. The team began work on color alignment and the critical signup/login flows, laying the foundation for the iOS application that will extend Cooking's reach to mobile users.
