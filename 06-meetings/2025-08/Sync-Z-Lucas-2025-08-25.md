# Sync Z <> Lucas - Project Status & Design Adaptation

**Date:** 2025-08-25
**Duration:** ~17 minutes
**Attendees:** Lucas Cufré, Zen, Marcos Tacca
**Meeting Type:** Weekly Sync

## Executive Summary

Comprehensive sync covering multiple workstreams including blocker resolution, design adaptation, delivery timeline clarification, and team restructuring. Lucas confirmed Hyperliquid integration is nearly complete with referral code account generation planned for same day. Team successfully adapted Leo's new designs (typefaces, colors, buttons, iconography) and expects timely delivery. Shakib introduced as new senior technical lead complementing Naji's trading-focused role. Beta testing access model discussed using referral code limits. Dubai trip pushed to late October (after 27th) due to Zen's Japan travel.

## Discussion Topics

### Project Blockers and Progress

**Current Blockers:**
- **Apple Account:** Only remaining blocker
  - Greg requested splash screen (already deployed)
  - DNS now configured

**Hyperliquid Integration:**
- Nearly complete
- Referral code account generation scheduled for same day
- DNS blocker resolved

**Timeline:** 00:00:00

### Design Adaptation and Scope

**Leo's Design Integration:**
- **Status:** Adaptation in progress, can deliver on time
- **Included Elements:**
  - New typefaces
  - Color schemes
  - Buttons
  - Iconography
  - New wallet page design

**Out of Scope Items:**
- Some screens from Leo/R designs don't align with current product functionality
- Based on personal taste differences
- Deferred for later discussion to focus on delivery timeline

**Zen Question:** What will be missing from designs?

**Lucas Response:** Certain screens out of sync with product operation; prioritizing delivery timeline over complete design alignment

**Timeline:** 00:00:00 - 00:04:11

---

### Delivery Date and Beta Testing Access

**Delivery Timeline Discussion:**

**Lucas Question:** Expected delivery date options:
- September 30th (Tuesday)
- September 26th
- October 3rd (Friday after Sept 30)

**Zen Response:**
- Date will be determined after handover version review
- Team will review together and provide final date

**Beta Tester Access Model:**

**Current Approach:** Whitelist system (not scalable for open beta)

**Proposed Model (Similar to Bul):**
- Each referral link has limited number of uses
- Cap users per referral code (5-10 suggested)
- Zen to confirm if this is still the plan

**Lucas Concern:** Potential ramifications need dedicated discussion once model confirmed

**Timeline:** 00:04:11 - 00:08:13

---

### TradingView Chart Update

**Status:** Update planned for next week or two

**Reason for Delay:** Reallocating workforce to visual alignment

**Lucas Note:** Acknowledged importance to Zen's team, will update once complete

**Timeline:** 00:08:13

### Team Structure: Shakib's Expanded Role

**Shakib's New Responsibilities:**
- **Similar to Naji but broader scope**
- **Key Focus Areas:**
  - Security
  - Architecture
  - Research on new features
  - Timeline and launch support
  - Main product point of contact

**Naji's Adjusted Role:**
- **Restricted to trading-related features**
- **Reason:** Naji is experienced trader, will focus on his expertise
- **Remains on team** but in specialized capacity

**Shakib's Capabilities:**
- Research expertise
- Code diving/technical depth
- Feature interpretation and decision-making
- Better technical expertise than Naji for architecture decisions

**Transition Timeline:**
- Needs a few weeks to get started
- Currently wrapping up other projects
- Will become full-time on Cooking after transition

## Transcript Highlights

### Design Adaptation (00:04:11)
```
Lucas: "So the new type faces, colors, the buttons, I believe the iconography,
I believe most of that. I believe the new the new wallet page as well that is
going to be included. We're going to get as close as we can in that timeline."

Zen: "Ok, cool. Um, ok. What's going to be missing though from the designs?"

Lucas: "So there are some things that we need to uh have a conversation with
Leo about regarding mainly some some screens that he and R designed are that
are out of sync with how the product work... I'm going to leave that for later.
Mainly because right now I need to focus on delivering the product in the
timeline that we agreed on."
```

### Beta Access Model (00:06:58)
```
Zen: "It'll be similar to like um Bul way they did it was that each referral
link um uh each referral link has a certain number of people that it can be
shared with and then they have access to the the platform."

Lucas: "Ok. So what we can do... it's cap an amount of users per uh custom
code per referal code. So let's say five per referal code or 10 per referral
code."

Zen: "Yeah, something like that."

Lucas: "This is a longer conversation so let's have it maybe once you can
confirm this is going to be the way we should allocate some time to discuss
it further because there are some ramifications some potential ramifications
we need to discuss."
```

### Shakib's Role (00:09:45 - 00:10:48)
```
Zen: "Shakib is going to be um key on things like security, things on like
um the architecture, research on new things, new features, um supporting on
like timelines and uh launches and stuff like that. He'll basically become
like the main point of contact um for the product on our side."

Zen: "Naji is now restricted... Naji is going to be remaining only on like
trading related features because Naji is a trader."

Lucas: "Ok ok ok can we do anything to help smoothen this transition?"

Zen: "Uh yeah, if you can um if you can just share any technical resources
internally that we have um to keep that would be thatd be really good for
him to get up to speed."
```

### Communication Preferences (00:12:15)
```
Lucas: "My Telegram account it's mainly located to to a workphone that I
keep on my house. So there are going to be sometimes that I'm not going to
be as fast as to answer mainly because I don't have it on me... if anything
is more urgent uh maybe an email it's going to reach me quicker because I
have it on my phone."
```

## Notes
- Lucas limiting meetings to maintain focus on delivery sprint
- Team confident in meeting delivery timeline with design updates
- Shakib transition represents significant organizational change
- Communication preferences updated for better responsiveness
