# Weekly Demo - August 1, 2025

**Date:** 2025-08-01
**Time:** Not specified
**Attendees:** RatherLabs Development Team, Cooking Team
**Facilitator:** Not specified

## Executive Summary

This week delivered important platform expansions and infrastructure improvements across multiple components. The backend and indexer teams successfully implemented support for Let'sBonk, adding another launchpad to the platform's capabilities. The backend team also completed a critical update to Turnkey's implementation, simplifying wallet creation logic and improving scalability for social login features, which will be essential as the platform grows its user base.

The indexer team added support for Raydium Launchpad and updated the Liquidity and Bonding Curve databases, expanding the platform's ability to track and trade newly launched tokens. These additions ensure Cooking remains competitive in supporting emerging token launch platforms.

Frontend development continued the important work of synchronizing the Figma design library with previous Ooze designs, ensuring visual consistency across all platform interfaces. The Perpetuals UI entered the testing phase, moving closer to production readiness. Mobile development achieved a significant milestone with Kitchen integration completed and the Home UI finished. However, the team faces a critical blocker with Apple Account access preventing TestFlight deployment, which is delaying the QA process and potentially impacting delivery timelines.

## Action Items

- [ ] **Obtain Apple Account for TestFlight** - Assigned to: Management - Due: Immediate - Priority: Critical
- [ ] **Complete Perpetuals UI testing** - Assigned to: Frontend Team - Due: Next week - Priority: High
- [ ] **Deploy Let'sBonk to production** - Assigned to: Backend/Indexer Teams - Due: Next sprint - Priority: Medium
- [ ] **Begin mobile QA once TestFlight available** - Assigned to: Mobile Team - Due: When unblocked - Priority: High

## Topics: Breakdown

### Topic 1: Backend Platform Expansions

#### Executive Summary
Backend team successfully implemented Let'sBonk support and completed critical authentication infrastructure improvements for better scalability.

#### Key Takeaways
- Completed Let'sBonk implementation
- Updated Turnkey implementation for simplified wallet creation
- Improved scalability for social login features
- Enhanced wallet creation logic for better performance

#### Discussion Details
The Turnkey update is particularly significant as it simplifies the wallet creation process and improves scalability for social login, preparing the platform for increased user adoption through various authentication methods.

### Topic 2: Indexer Launchpad Support

#### Executive Summary
Indexer team expanded platform capabilities by adding support for additional launchpads and updating critical database structures.

#### Key Takeaways
- Completed Let'sBonk implementation
- Added Raydium Launchpad implementation
- Updated Liquidity database structure
- Updated Bonding Curve database structure

#### Discussion Details
Supporting multiple launchpads is crucial for comprehensive token coverage. Raydium Launchpad is particularly important as it's one of the primary token launch venues on Solana.

---

### Topic 3: Frontend Design Synchronization

#### Executive Summary
Frontend team continued critical work on design system alignment while advancing Perpetuals UI toward production readiness.

#### Key Takeaways
- Continued synchronization between Figma library and Ooze designs
- Currently testing Perpetuals UI
- Working toward complete visual consistency

#### Discussion Details
The design synchronization effort ensures that all UI components follow a consistent visual language, which is essential for professional appearance and user experience.

---

### Topic 4: Mobile Development and Blockers

#### Executive Summary
Mobile team completed significant development milestones but faces critical blocker preventing testing and deployment.

#### Key Takeaways
- Completed Kitchen integration
- Finished Home UI implementation
- Blocked by lack of Apple Account for TestFlight deployment
- QA testing cannot begin without TestFlight access

#### Discussion Details
The Apple Account blocker is critical as it prevents any testing of the mobile application. This could significantly impact delivery timelines if not resolved quickly. The completed Kitchen integration and Home UI represent substantial progress that cannot be validated without testing infrastructure.

## Decisions Made

1. **Prioritize Apple Account acquisition** - Critical blocker for mobile progress
2. **Continue launchpad integrations** - Expand platform coverage
3. **Maintain design synchronization** - Ensure consistency before major release

## Blockers and Risks Identified

- **Apple Account for TestFlight** - Impact: Critical - Owner: Management - Needs resolution by: Immediate
- **Mobile delivery timeline risk** - Impact: High - Owner: Mobile Team - Dependent on TestFlight access

## Parking Lot

- Additional launchpad integrations
- Mobile Android development timeline
- Advanced social login features

## Next Steps

- Urgently acquire Apple Developer Account
- Complete Perpetuals UI testing
- Deploy Let'sBonk and Raydium Launchpad support
- Begin mobile QA immediately upon TestFlight access
