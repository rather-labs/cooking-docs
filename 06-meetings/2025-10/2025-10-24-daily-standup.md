## Individual Updates

### Javier Grajales (QA)

**Completed:**
- Configured "top percentage holder" feature for advance orders
- Configured "auto priority fee" for future order execution
- Created threads for various design topics
- Deep dive into order testing
- Identified missing frontend data: average percentage time holding
- Organizing order regression testing

**In Progress:**
- Reviewing Advance Orders tables
- Finalizing regression test cases list

**Next Steps:**
- Polish format and decide display location for regression test cases (with Lucas)
- Continue testing advance orders with different states

**Notes:**
- Tables without history show only active or paused orders
- Historical view shows different columns (e.g., order size in TWAP unknown until execution)
- Historical = transactions tracking, Non-historical = orders tracking

---

### Byron Chavarria (Mobile - iOS)

**Completed:**
- Integrated access token handling via cookies (PR submitted)

**In Progress:**
- Working on limit orders creation and sell functionality
- Dealing with iOS modal overlay limitations

**Blockers:**
- iOS 16 + Swift 5 doesn't support sheet-over-sheet (modal on modal)
- Newer iOS versions support it, but maintaining backward compatibility
- Need alternative solution: hide and show modals sequentially

**Technical Context:**
- Issue is retrocompatibility with iOS 16 and Swift 5
- Newer Swift versions support "sheet over sheet" natively

---

### Eduardo Yuschuk (Backend/Indexer Lead)

**Completed:**
- Integrated SPL Token 2022 standard support
- Supported in Raydium Launchpad for pool creation
- Working on fixing initial amounts in order creation to prevent mismatches

**In Progress:**
- Investigating "timestamp zero" issue in trade logs
- Proposed solution: Add traceability column in PostgreSQL to identify malformed block sources

**Technical Details - Blockchain Data Collection:**
- Uses two concurrent implementations:
  1. **WebSockets** - Real-time blockchain data
  2. **Geyser protocol** - Alternative data source
- Both try to insert next block into PostgreSQL table (only one succeeds due to unique constraint)
- Indexer polls PostgreSQL to process the data

**Architecture:**
```
Blockchain ‚Üí WebSockets ‚Üò
                          ‚Üí PostgreSQL (unique block constraint) ‚Üí Indexer (polling)
Blockchain ‚Üí Geyser    ‚Üó
```

### Esteban Restrepo (Backend Developer)

**Completed:**
- Worked on "Your Orders" section within "Token Details"
- Enabled CORS for transaction microservices
- Adjusted priority fee for automated trading algorithms

**In Progress:**
- Understanding "conditions" card for custom orders

**Questions Resolved:**
- Conditions refer to JSON field within limit orders (explained by Martin)

**Next Steps:**
- Test with balance and upload all order fixes

---

### Federico Caffaro (Backend Developer)

**Completed:**
- Approved Transactionator PR
- Fixed "top 10 holders" issue

**Next Steps:**
- Decide where to place/deploy the Transactionator

---

### Marko Jauregui (Frontend Developer)

**Completed:**
- Multiple ticket fixes:
  - Improved wallet manager
  - Added Solscan links to transaction receipts
  - Hide tokens with zero liquidity

**Next Steps:**
- Review withdraw and transfer modals to pre-select active wallet by default

---

### German Derbes Catoni (Frontend Developer)

**Completed:**
- Updated portfolio with skeleton loaders
- Fixed token images display
- Fixed "Not Found" page
- Standardized number formatting across app

**In Progress:**
- Continuing number formatting fixes across different screens

**Next Steps:**
- Fix remaining number formatting issues throughout the application

---

### Luis Rivera (Frontend Developer)

**Completed - Perpetuals Trading Features:**
- Implemented USDC value display
- Implemented Open Interest calculation
- Implemented ROE (Return on Equity) calculation for PNL
- Working on various perpetuals-related tickets

**Questions Resolved:**
- **Available Balance in Perpetuals:**
  - PNL (Profit and Loss) should NOT affect available balance
  - Whether PNL is positive or negative, it doesn't change available balance
  - Margin is paid specifically for this purpose

**Next Steps:**
- Continue working on pending tickets
- Remove addition/subtraction from available balance in Perpetuals

---

### Santiago Gimenez (Developer)

**Assigned:**
- Review Hyperliquid pattern for editing take profit and stop loss in transactions

---

## Key Discussions

### 1. Advance Orders Table Display

**Context:** Understanding what to show in historical vs. non-historical views

**Decisions:**
- Non-historical tables show only active or paused orders
- Historical tables may show additional columns
- Example: TWAP order size is unknown until execution time
- Historical = transactions, Non-historical = orders (different entities)

---

### 2. iOS Modal Limitations

**Problem:** iOS 16 + Swift 5 doesn't support sheet-over-sheet (modal on modal)

**Impact:** Affects limit order creation/sell flows on mobile

**Solution:**
- Use alternative approach: hide and show modals sequentially
- Maintain backward compatibility with iOS 16

**Technical Note:** Newer iOS versions support this natively, but can't drop iOS 16 support yet

---

### 3. Blockchain Indexer Architecture

**Question:** How does the indexer collect blockchain data?

**Answer (Eduardo):**
- Two concurrent implementations: WebSockets + Geyser protocol
- Both attempt to insert next block into PostgreSQL
- Table has unique constraint - only one insertion succeeds
- Indexer polls PostgreSQL to process blocks
- Martin clarified the polling mechanism

---

### 4. Perpetuals Available Balance Calculation

**Question:** Should PNL affect available balance in Perpetuals?

**Answer (Lucas):**
- NO - PNL should not affect available balance
- Applies whether PNL is positive or negative
- Margin is paid specifically to cover this
- Available balance remains constant regardless of unrealized PNL

**Action:** Luis to remove PNL addition/subtraction from available balance

---

### 5. Perpetuals Take Profit / Stop Loss Editing

**Requirement:** Need ability to edit TP/SL on open positions

**Current State:** Cannot edit TP/SL after position is created

**Action:** Santiago to review Hyperliquid's pattern for implementing this feature

---

### 6. Error Message Standardization

**Problem:** Inconsistent error messages between backend and frontend

**Discussion (Martin & Lucas):**
- Need to standardize error messages across the platform
- Suggestion: Create error dictionary system for backend and frontend
- Should assign someone to lead this initiative
- Related to recently completed error documentation work

**Note:** This aligns with the Backend Error Handling Guide created earlier this week

---

## Action Items

### High Priority

- [ ] **Javier Grajales:** Finalize regression test cases format and display location (collaborate with Lucas)
- [ ] **German Derbes Catoni:** Fix number formatting issues across all screens
- [ ] **Luis Rivera:** Remove PNL addition/subtraction from Perpetuals available balance
- [ ] **Santiago Gimenez:** Research Hyperliquid's TP/SL editing pattern

### Medium Priority

- [ ] **Esteban Restrepo:** Test order fixes with balance and upload changes
- [ ] **Federico Caffaro:** Decide Transactionator deployment location
- [ ] **Marko Jauregui:** Update withdraw/transfer modals to pre-select active wallet
- [ ] **Byron Chavarria:** Implement iOS modal workaround for sheet-over-sheet limitation

### Future Discussion

- [ ] **Team:** Assign owner for error message standardization initiative
- [ ] **Team:** Create error dictionary system for backend/frontend

---

## Technical Notes

### SPL Token 2022 Integration

- New token standard now supported
- Already working in Raydium Launchpad
- Allows handling of new token types with extended features

### Blockchain Indexer Design Pattern

**Dual-Source Architecture:**
```
WebSockets + Geyser ‚Üí PostgreSQL (unique constraint) ‚Üí Indexer (polling)
```

**Benefits:**
- Redundancy: Two data sources
- Consistency: Unique constraint prevents duplicates
- Reliability: If one source fails, other continues

### iOS Compatibility Constraint

**Issue:** Sheet-over-sheet not supported in iOS 16 + Swift 5
**Workaround:** Sequential modal display (hide/show)
**Long-term:** Will be resolved when iOS 16 support is dropped

---

## Decisions Made

1. ‚úÖ **Perpetuals PNL Calculation:** PNL does not affect available balance (positive or negative)
2. ‚úÖ **Historical vs Non-Historical Tables:** Different entities - transactions vs orders
3. ‚úÖ **iOS Modal Strategy:** Use sequential display workaround for backward compatibility

---

## Client Feedback

**Positive Note (Lucas):** Client is requesting many small frontend adjustments, which indicates the team is doing good work and the platform is being actively used and tested.

---

## Follow-up Required

### Error Standardization Initiative
