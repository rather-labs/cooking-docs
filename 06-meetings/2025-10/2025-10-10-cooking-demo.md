## Executive Summary

The team focused heavily on Safari browser compatibility, resolving rendering issues that didn't appear in Chrome (72% of users). Major UI improvements included accelerated position query rendering, debugging of trade history tables, and updated advanced orders interface. Echo integration remains blocked, preventing progress on transaction optimization. Critical security discussions centered on implementing redundancy with fallback routing and transaction verification to protect against backend compromise. Team committed to working Saturday to meet delivery deadlines, with Ali conducting final QA after development team completes their testing.

## Meeting Details

**Duration:** 24 minutes
**Platform:** Google Meet
**Recording:** Available

## Topics Discussed

### 1. Safari Browser Compatibility Issues

**Context:** Leo's testing revealed significant rendering differences between Chrome and Safari browsers.

**Discovery Process:**
- Team primarily developed and tested on Chrome (72% of worldwide internet devices)
- Leo raised concerns, revealing he was testing on Safari
- Review of Safari revealed multiple browser-specific issues
- Chrome and Safari use fundamentally different rendering technologies

**Issues Identified:**
- Image rendering: Images appearing blurry in Safari
- Typography: Font rendering differs between browsers
- Token handling: Different approach to token processing
- Image handling: Safari-specific image optimization issues
- Alignment problems: Various UI elements misaligned in Safari

**Current Status:**
- Active fine-tuning of browser differences
- Both frontend engineers dedicated to resolving issues
- Ali also reviewing for additional discrepancies

**Process:**
- Ali conducting parallel testing
- Any missed issues will be added to pipeline
- Comprehensive Safari compatibility sweep underway

### 2. UI Improvements & Performance Optimization

**Advanced Orders Interface:**
- Updated to latest design
- Several visual bugs identified and being fixed:
  - Opens on limit order instead of market order (incorrect default)
  - Alignment issues with token data placeholder
  - Placeholder should only appear when token selected
- Tables updated to new design
- Living orders and DCA history views improved

**Position Query Acceleration:**
- Significant rendering speed improvements implemented
- Queries now execute much faster
- Critical for user experience during active trading

**Trade History Table Debugging:**
- Speed optimization to match active positions table
- Performance parity being established
- Ensures consistent user experience across different views

**Wallet Manager Enhancements:**
- Wallet identification: System now recognizes saved withdrawal wallets and Cooking wallets
- Auto-naming: Displays saved wallet names instead of addresses
- Unknown wallets: Still show as addresses if not saved
- Transaction clarity: Clear identification of Cooking-to-Cooking transfers
- Developer wallet tracking: Backend developer wallets identified for testing

### 3. Quick Search Feature Discussion

**Proposal:** Naji suggested implementing Bulls-style clipboard search in top bar

**Functionality:**
- Automatically detect contract address in clipboard
- Display contract in rolling top bar
- Eliminates need to paste into search field
- Provides quick access to recently copied contracts

**Challenges:**
- Clipboard access requires user permission
- Device-level security considerations
- Implementation complexity around permission handling

**Decision:**
- Feature acknowledged as valuable
- Naji has mentioned this feature multiple times previously
- Deferred to post-launch release
- Added to future feature pipeline

**Quote:**
> "I have mentioned this feature quite a few times actually." - Naji Osmat

### 4. Echo Integration Blockers

**Current Status:** Blocked and preventing progress on transaction optimization

**Impact:**
- Transaction speed improvements delayed
- Unable to test Echo-provided instructions
- Limited advancement possible without resolution

**Planned Action:**
- Meeting scheduled (potentially next day) to address blockers
- Goal: Get integration back on track

**Timeline Concern:**
- Lucas expressed doubt about completing Echo integration by end of week
- Team can deliver refactored solution with improved execution times
- Echo-specific features will require more time

**Dependency:**
- Echo integration critical for optimal transaction routing
- Blocking implementation of advanced security features

### 5. Transaction Security & Redundancy Architecture

**Context:** Zen emphasized critical importance of security measures if Echo backend is compromised.

**Redundancy Requirements:**

**Auto-Routing Fallback System:**
- Backup trade routing must activate if Echo goes down
- Ensures continuous trading capability
- No single point of failure

**Transaction Verification Layer:**
- All transactions must be verified before user signing
- Protection against compromised Echo backend
- Prevents malicious transaction signing
- Critical for user fund security

**Quote:**
> "If their backend is ever compromised, we need to pass transactions before making users sign the transactions from users accounts just in case their backend is ever compromised." - Zen

### 6. Transaction Validation Architecture

**Implementation Status:**
- Refactor with DNS records includes built-in fallback system
- Uses current execution methods as backup
- Ready for testing once Echo integration unblocked

**Full Scope Implementation:**
- Echo integration includes all discussed security layers
- Transaction verification before user signing
- Backend compromise protection

**Verification Process Details:**

**Pattern Matching System:**
- Dissects every Echo transaction before broadcast
- Validates against approved patterns
- Patterns updated over time as platform evolves
- Rejects any transactions outside approved patterns

**In-House Processing:**
- All verification runs locally on Cooking backend
- Avoids external service dependencies
- Eliminates latency from third-party validation calls
- Maintains transaction speed while ensuring security

**Advanced Attack Protection:**

**Scenario:** Rogue/compromised backend creating fake liquidity pools

**Attack Vector:**
- Hackers create fraudulent liquidity pools
- Users unknowingly buy tokens from fake pools
- Liquidity withdrawn simultaneously
- Transaction appears as normal swap pattern

**Protection Mechanism:**
- System validates specific token contract address
- Compares requested token with transaction target
- Rejects transactions to wrong pools or tokens
- Ensures user buys intended token only

**Technical Implementation:**
- Main contract address verification
- Token matching validation
- Pool authenticity checks
- Real-time validation without latency impact

**Quote from Martin:**
> "We are matching that the transaction is for the token that the user wanted to buy originally."

### 7. Portfolio & Account Enhancements

**Missing Tokens Placeholder:**
- New placeholder image for empty wallets
- Displays: "Hey, you don't have any tokens yet"
- Improved user experience for new users

**Settings Page:**
- Configuration options updated
- User preferences accessible

**Real-Time Updates:**
- Token purchases appear immediately in portfolio
- Selling entire holdings updates within seconds
- Active positions table updates in real-time
- Trade history table optimization ongoing

**Partner Program:**
- Latest login screen design implemented
- Currently being tested by Lucas personally
- New design iteration from Leo integrated

**Trade History Model:**
- Updated modal for trade history
- Images integrated into display
- Soul Scan links to be added
- Transaction trail review capability

### 8. Apple Credentials & KYB Status

**Apple Developer Account:**
- Credentials obtained and provided to team
- Mobile engineer reported no issues or blockers
- Naji resolved account access previous day
- Development proceeding smoothly

**KYB for Onramper:**
- Identified as main blocker for on-ramp integration
- Lucas investigating DNS record impact on solution
- Quick meeting held with Zen (~30 minutes before demo)
- DNS records not yet impacting the system

**Gregory's Action Items:**
- Attempting to resolve KYB issue same day
- Discussing with Zen for company details
- Exploring use of existing Onramper credentials if needed
- Investigating if old Onramper account can be repurposed

**Concerns:**
- Using existing credentials may cause account flagging
- Account suspension would be major setback
- Need proper company credentials for production

### 9. Quality Assurance Process

**Development Team QA:**
- Team working Saturday to meet delivery deadlines
- Comprehensive internal testing before handoff
- Updated position queries to be deployed end of day or following day
- Stress testing before production push

**External QA Process:**
- Ali conducting parallel testing during development
- Ali to perform final QA after development team completes their testing
- Ensures all development feedback addressed before final review
- Prevents comments being missed in production deployment

**Quote from Gregory:**
> "I was going to get Ali doing it once they've been there QA. Get him to do it again after they've done their QA and make sure they fixed what he said basically."
