# Sync Z <> Lucas - QA Concerns & Product Quality

**Date:** 2025-09-15
**Duration:** ~16 minutes
**Attendees:** Lucas Cufré, Zen, Marcos Tacca
**Meeting Type:** Weekly Sync / Critical Issues

## Executive Summary

**Critical discussion** addressing significant product quality concerns raised by Zen. Despite having full-time QA engineer, numerous bugs persist and partners are discovering issues that should have been caught internally. Lucas explained that many bugs are being addressed, additional QA resources are being added (at Rather Labs' expense, not charged to client), and comprehensive issue mapping will be provided by end of day. Zen expressed deep concern that product is "not even close to usable" as MVP, citing broken features, incorrect calculations, and loading time issues. Meeting concluded with reaffirmed October 3rd deadline and Lucas's commitment that team is "putting everything on the line" to deliver quality product.

## Discussion Topics

### QA Process and Bug Management

**Zen's Primary Concerns:**
- Large number of persisting bugs despite QA engineer investment
- Product not close to usable state, even as MVP
- Partners and financiers detecting issues that QA should catch
- Concerns about Rather Labs' reputation impact

**Lucas's Response - Current State:**
- Many bugs being actively tackled
- Multiple reported issues under resolution
- QA absorbed by Rather Labs partner (Rabs)
- **Additional QA being added** (Rather Labs' cost, not client expense)

**Purpose of Additional QA:**
- Widen testing scope
- Research every minute detail
- Test across all product areas
- Meet 3-week delivery timeline

**Lucas Commitment:**
- Comprehensive list of all mapped issues by end of day
- Current status of all fixes
- Transparency on massive workload being addressed

**Timeline:** 00:05:47 - 00:08:13

### Specific Bug Examples and Issues

**DPNL Calculation Errors:**
- **Affected Tokens:** "Pengu" and "Launchpad" only
- **Status:** Under investigation
- **Other Tokens:** 100% accurate calculations
- **Team Action:** Researching root cause, unable to replicate with other tokens

**UI Alignment Issues:**
- **Resolution:** Will be addressed in upcoming UI update
- **Scope:** Portfolio modal and related screens

**Quick Access to Token Page:**
- **Status:** Never included in original scope
- **Lucas Offer:** Can add without problem
- **Context:** Feature request, not a bug

**Quick Operations Panel:**
- **Issue:** Stopped loading
- **Team Status:** Unable to replicate on their end
- **Internal Testing:** Always responsive
- **Action:** Continue testing to identify root cause

**Timeline:** 00:09:52

### Product State Assessment

**Zen's Frank Assessment:**
- "Product is not even close to usable"
- "Not even close to MVP, never mind beta"
- Features being built and tested, but broken upon handover
- "Most things that are fundamental simply don't work"
- Loading times problematic (DevOps working on it)

**Zen's Frustration:**
- Close to a year of development
- Enormous investment in Rather Labs
- Cannot justify broken product to partners/financiers
- Seeing potential "red flags" developing

**Historical Context (Zen's Perspective):**
- Multiple previous burn rate increases to improve delivery
- Past attempts to accelerate roadmap or improve quality
- "Not the first time we've gone through this"
- High initial confidence based on Rather Labs' past client references

**Zen's Expectations:**
- "Expecting fireworks in next two weeks"
- Pinning hopes on QA process improvement
- Additional QA should resolve issues "overnight like within two weeks"
- Need everyone "pulling that A game"

**Timeline:** 00:11:16 - 00:12:28

### Quality Expectations and Team Commitment

**Lucas's Assurance:**
- Team "putting everything on the line to meet deadlines"
- Striving for perfection
- Understands Zen's frustration completely
- Comprehensive mapping and transparency coming

**Zen's Investment Context:**
- Enormous investment in Cooking
- Enormous investment specifically in Rather Labs
- Decision based on strong past client references
- Understands teething pains are normal
- **But:** Current volume of issues is "scary"

**Zen's Theory:**
- QA hasn't done job properly
- Additional QA will solve everything quickly
- Not unaware of normal product rollout challenges
- Current state exceeds normal teething pain threshold

**Timeline:** 00:12:28

### Deadline Confirmation

**Lucas Question:** Revisit delivery timeline options:
- September 30th (last week Friday)
- October 3rd (Friday after Sept 30, which is Tuesday)

**Zen Response:**
- **October 3rd is fine**
- Won't shave off few days if it means anything less than perfection
- Quality over speed at this point

**Final Deadline:** October 3rd, 2025

**Timeline:** 00:12:28 - 00:13:33

## Transcript Highlights

### QA Resource Addition (00:07:03 - 00:08:13)
```
Zen: "We're expending like a significant significant enormous burn rate on
development and I don't think us paying for an extra resource because like
we've done development sprints and product rollouts so many times and one
QA full-time engineer should definitely be picking up these kind of things
immediately."

Lucas: "Sorry if I misspoke but this would not be allocated to you. So this
would not be an expense to you. This would be on our side. So you would not
be including your burn rate. You would not be adding an extra expense."
```

### Product State Reality Check (00:11:16)
```
Zen: "The way it is right now, the product is not even it's not even close
to usable. Like this is not even close to like an MVP. Never mind a beta.
So, I'm really expecting fireworks in the next two weeks because right now
it's extremely worrying that we have a handover coming soon and um you know
there's so much fault, there's so many faults."
```

### Investment Context (00:12:28)
```
Zen: "For us we've invested an enormous amount into cooking but into rather
labs like an enormous amount and the only reason we did it is because we
spoke to past projects past clients who routed very highly and um just the
state of it right now... It's very very worrying."

Zen: "I understand there's always teething pains, there's always things that
go wrong, but the amount of things right now is just scary."
```

### Deadline Decision (00:12:28)
```
Lucas: "October the 3d. Is that viable or do you want to move it up to to
the 30th?"

Zen: "No, October the 3d is is fine. And I I don't want to shave off a few
days and then for it for there to be any you know anything less than perfection."
```

## Notes
- Most critical/tense meeting in the series
- Reflects accumulated frustration with product quality
- Despite concerns, both parties committed to resolution
- Deadline provides 2.5 weeks for intensive bug fixes
- Lucas taking full responsibility and adding resources
- Zen's concerns legitimate but maintains faith in team's ability to deliver
