# DevOps Session 2 - Security & Production Readiness - Cooking.gg
**Date:** September 4, 2025, 14:29 GMT-03:00
**Duration:** ~25 minutes
**Meeting Type:** Technical Deep Dive - DevOps Security
**Attendees:** Lucas Cufre, Martin Aranda, Eduardo Yuschuk

## Executive Summary
Second DevOps session focused on security hardening, SSL/TLS configuration, WAF setup, DDoS protection, compliance considerations, and final production readiness checklist.

## Meeting Context
Continuation of earlier DevOps discussion, focusing on security measures required before production launch, including API security, data encryption, access controls, and compliance with security best practices.

## Technical Discussion

### SSL/TLS & Certificate Management
- **ACM (AWS Certificate Manager)**: Free SSL/TLS certificates for all domains
- **Automatic Renewal**: ACM handles certificate renewal automatically
- **Strong Cipher Suites**: TLS 1.2+ only, disable weak ciphers
- **HSTS Headers**: Force HTTPS, prevent downgrade attacks
- **Certificate Pinning**: Consider for mobile apps in future

### API Security
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement per-user and per-IP rate limits
- **API Keys**: Rotate API keys for third-party services monthly
- **CORS Configuration**: Whitelist only approved origins
- **Input Validation**: Sanitize all user inputs, validate against schemas
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Use parameterized queries exclusively

### WAF & DDoS Protection
- **AWS WAF**: Web Application Firewall with managed rule sets
- **Rate-Based Rules**: Block IPs exceeding request thresholds
- **Geo-Blocking**: Block traffic from sanctioned countries if needed
- **CloudFront Shield**: Basic DDoS protection included with CloudFront
- **Advanced DDoS Protection**: Evaluate AWS Shield Advanced if needed

### Access Control & IAM
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Grant minimum permissions required
- **IAM Roles**: Use roles for ECS tasks, avoid long-lived credentials
- **MFA Enforcement**: Require MFA for all AWS console access
- **Service Accounts**: Separate IAM users for CI/CD and services
- **Access Audit**: Regular review of IAM policies and permissions

### Data Encryption
- **At Rest**: RDS encryption enabled, S3 server-side encryption
- **In Transit**: TLS for all API communications, encrypted database connections
- **Application-Level**: Encrypt sensitive fields (private keys) with KMS
- **Key Management**: AWS KMS for encryption key management

### Production Readiness Checklist
**Pre-Launch Requirements**:
- [x] All services containerized and tested in staging
- [x] Database backups configured and tested
- [x] Monitoring and alerting set up
- [x] SSL certificates configured
- [x] Secrets stored in Secrets Manager
- [ ] Load testing completed
- [ ] Security audit completed
- [ ] Incident response plan documented
- [ ] On-call rotation established
- [ ] Runbook for common issues created

## Key Technical Decisions
- **Decision 1:** AWS WAF with managed rule sets - Cost-effective protection against common attacks
- **Decision 2:** Encryption at rest for all data stores - Security compliance and best practice
- **Decision 3:** IAM roles over access keys - Enhanced security, automatic credential rotation
- **Decision 4:** Rate limiting at multiple layers - API Gateway + application-level
- **Decision 5:** CloudFront + WAF for DDoS protection - Sufficient for expected scale

## Action Items
- [ ] **Marcos**: Configure WAF rules and test blocking behavior
- [ ] **Eduardo**: Enable encryption for RDS and S3
- [ ] **Martin**: Implement rate limiting in API Gateway and application
- [ ] **Team**: Complete load testing with simulated beta user load
- [ ] **Lucas**: Document incident response procedures
