# Cooking Platform Vision & Requirements

## Strategic Vision Questions

### Core Product Positioning

**Why Cooking?**
The fundamental question driving our platform development - what makes Cooking necessary as a product in the crypto ecosystem?

**Product Differentiation**
- What is the key differentiator that sets Cooking apart from competitors?
- Why focus on memecoin aggregation as the core value proposition?

### Target Market Analysis

**Market Segmentation**
- Which specific market segments are we targeting and why?
- Who is the ideal customer profile for Cooking?
  - Crypto-native traders
  - Non-crypto natives entering the space
  - Professional traders
  - Retail investors

### Success Metrics & Objectives

**Long-term Goals**
- What is the ultimate objective for Cooking as a platform?
- How do we define and measure success?
  - User acquisition metrics
  - Trading volume targets
  - Market share objectives
  - User retention rates

### Revenue Model

**Monetization Strategy**
- How does Cooking generate revenue and become profitable?
- Revenue streams:
  - Trading fees (1% commission)
  - Referral program
  - Premium features
  - Additional services

## Platform Development Observations

### Technical Architecture

**Wallet Management System**
- Current implementation: TurnKey (Custodial method)
  - Generates a wallet for each new user
  - Should display private key to users (not implemented in dev)
  - Supports seed phrase export
  - Requires address loading for fund withdrawal
  - Seed phrase import allows bypassing withdrawal restrictions

**Current Limitations**
- Cannot import existing accounts for operations
- No support for external wallet integration initially

### Trading Operations Issues

**Execution Challenges**
- Experiencing errors during quick and custom operations:
  - Extended execution times
  - Transaction emission failures

**Competitor Analysis - BullX Neo**
How does BullX Neo solve these challenges?
- Combination of optimization techniques:
  - MEV ON/OFF toggle
  - Priority fee management
  - Bribe mechanisms
  - BDNs/SWQoS (Blockchain Direct Networks/Service Quality)

## Product Enhancement Ideas

### Copycat Detection System

**Problem Statement**
"Check if the meme has been used before, as copycat memes might be riskier"

**Proposed Solution**
- Develop a system to identify potential duplicate tokens
- Help traders make better-informed investment decisions
- Questions to address:
  - Does copycat detection actually impact trading decisions?
  - How does it affect asset virality?

### Social Sentiment Analysis

**Social Pulse Monitoring**
Current market indicators suggest monitoring:
- Active discussions and updates
- Genuine engagement metrics
- Social media mentions and buzz
- Influencer engagement tracking

**Implementation Considerations**
- How can we better inform traders about token social sentiment?
- How do we effectively communicate asset hype to Cooking users?
- AI pattern detection possibilities:
  - Is AI necessary for this feature?
  - What additional capabilities could AI provide?
- Pre-launch hype tracking:
  - Should we track pre-launch sentiment?
  - Is this an important metric for users?
