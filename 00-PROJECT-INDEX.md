- [Recent Technical Decisions](02-decisions/_decisions-index.md)

## Documentation Standards
All documents in this knowledge base follow these conventions:
- **YAML frontmatter** with metadata for easy discovery
- **Date format:** YYYY-MM-DD
- **File naming:** lowercase-with-hyphens.md
- **Decisions:** Use ADR format with sequential IDs (ADR-001, ADR-002, etc.)
- **Summaries:** All documents include a summary for LLM context
- **Cross-linking:** Bidirectional links between related documents

## How to Use This Knowledge Base

### For Team Members
- **Finding information:** Start here at the index, or use VS Code search
- **Adding structured content:** Use templates in each category folder
- **Adding unstructured content:** Drop files in [08-documents-to-parse/](08-documents-to-parse/) and let Claude Code structure them
- **Making decisions:** Use the [decision template](02-decisions/_template-decision.md)
- **Meeting notes:** Use the [meeting template](06-meetings/_template-meeting.md) or drop raw notes in [08-documents-to-parse/](08-documents-to-parse/)

### Unstructured Content Workflow
Have meeting notes, email threads, or research findings that need structure?

1. **Drop files** in [08-documents-to-parse/](08-documents-to-parse/)
2. **Claude Code parses** the content automatically
3. **Structured documents** are created in appropriate locations
4. **Indexes updated** for discoverability
5. **Original file deleted** after successful processing

See [Documents to Parse README](08-documents-to-parse/README.md) for details and examples.

### For AI Assistants (Claude Code, etc.)
- See [.claude/instructions.md](.claude/instructions.md) for detailed guidance
- Always check this index first for navigation
- Prioritize recent status and decisions
