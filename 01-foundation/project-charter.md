# Project Charter: Cooking.gg Platform

## Executive Summary
Cooking.gg is a Solana-based trading platform designed specifically for the growing market of meme-based tokens, with potential to expand to other blockchains in the future. The platform focuses on delivering a simple-to-use yet engaging experience that appeals to both experienced traders and newcomers to cryptocurrency trading. It leverages established protocols like Pump.fun, Moonshot, and Raydium to enable seamless token trading within these ecosystems.

The platform differentiates itself from competitors (BullX and Photon) by condensing key token views into a single comprehensive interface, introducing custom indicators like Diamond Hands, and offering a Quick Operations Panel that allows users to manage positions from anywhere on the platform. Additionally, a Telegram trading bot will provide an even more accessible trading experience, allowing users to execute trades directly from their messaging app.

The project targets the volatile meme-token trading market with a focus on simplicity, speed, and engagement through features like achievements, badges, leaderboards, and trading incentives.

## Project Purpose and Justification

### Business Problem or Opportunity
The cryptocurrency market has evolved to include a significant subcategory of meme or community coins (Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, etc.) that attract speculative investors due to extreme volatility and strong social media backing. While this market segment is served by existing platforms, there is an opportunity to provide a superior trading experience through:

- **Simplified onboarding** with Telegram authentication and custodial wallets
- **Streamlined interface** consolidating multiple views into single, comprehensive displays
- **Custom indicators** providing unique trading insights (Diamond Hands, Average Holding Time)
- **Quick Operations Panel** for position management without navigation overhead
- **Gamification** through leaderboards, achievements, and trading incentives

### Why Now?
- **Strong meme ecosystem on Solana** provides a robust foundation for the platform
- **Established protocols** (Pump.fun, Moonshot, Raydium) enable rapid integration
- **Competitor presence** (BullX, Photon) validates the market but shows room for differentiation
- **Growing mainstream interest** in meme tokens creates expanding user base
- **Technology maturity** in custodial wallets and blockchain infrastructure supports secure implementation

### Expected Business Value
- **Revenue generation** through platform fees on transactions
- **User acquisition** by lowering barriers to entry for crypto-inexperienced traders
- **Market differentiation** through unique features and superior UX
- **Platform stickiness** via gamification and social features
- **Scalability** for future blockchain integrations beyond Solana

## High-Level Objectives
1. **User-Friendly Experience** - Create an intuitive platform accessible to traders of all experience levels through Telegram login, custodial wallets, and streamlined interfaces
2. **Competitive Edge** - Differentiate through custom indicators (Diamond Hands), Quick Operations Panel, configurable hotkeys, and consolidated views
3. **Engaging User Interaction** - Implement achievements, badges, boosters, points system, and leaderboard with jackpot rewards to foster retention and active participation
4. **Scalability** - Design platform architecture to support future blockchain integrations beyond Solana
5. **Multi-Platform Access** - Deliver both web platform and Telegram bot for maximum accessibility

## Success Criteria
