# Multi-AZ Deployment for High Availability

## Context and Problem Statement

With the beta launch approaching in September/October 2025, Cooking.gg needed to ensure high availability and fault tolerance for the production environment. The platform handles real-time trading operations where downtime directly translates to missed trading opportunities and user frustration. A single availability zone deployment would create a single point of failure, risking extended outages if AWS experiences regional issues.

**Key Concerns:**
- Trading platform requires near-constant uptime for time-sensitive operations
- Users expect instant order execution and real-time price updates
- Reputational damage from extended downtime during beta launch
- Competitive disadvantage if reliability is questioned
- Financial impact of missed trading opportunities

**Decision Drivers:**
- **RTO (Recovery Time Objective):** Target < 4 hours for full system recovery
- **RPO (Recovery Point Objective):** Target < 15 minutes for acceptable data loss
- **User Expectations:** 99.9%+ uptime for trading platform
- **Cost Constraints:** Reasonable cost increase for enhanced availability
- **Operational Complexity:** Must be maintainable by small DevOps team

## Decision

**Implement Multi-AZ (Multi-Availability Zone) deployment for production environment across 3 availability zones in primary AWS region.**

### Architecture Components:

**Network Layer:**
- VPC spanning 3 availability zones
- Public and private subnets in each AZ
- Application Load Balancer distributing traffic across AZs
- NAT Gateway in each AZ for outbound traffic from private subnets

**Compute Layer (ECS):**
- ECS services with tasks distributed across multiple AZs
- Minimum 2 tasks per service for redundancy
- Auto-scaling configured to maintain AZ balance
- Health checks ensuring only healthy tasks receive traffic

**Database Layer:**
- RDS PostgreSQL with Multi-AZ deployment (automatic failover)
- Read replicas distributed across availability zones
- ElastiCache Redis with cluster mode enabled across AZs
- ClickHouse deployed with replication across zones

**Storage Layer:**
- S3 with cross-region replication for critical data
- EBS volumes with automatic snapshots
- Backup retention across multiple AZs

### High Availability Features:

1. **Automatic Failover:**
   - RDS: Automatic failover to standby instance (typically < 2 minutes)
   - ECS: Failed tasks automatically replaced in healthy AZs
   - Load Balancer: Automatic traffic rerouting away from unhealthy targets

2. **Data Redundancy:**
   - Database: Synchronous replication to standby instance
   - Redis: Multi-node cluster with automatic failover
   - S3: 99.999999999% durability with cross-region replication

3. **Monitoring & Alerting:**
   - CloudWatch alarms for AZ-level failures
   - SNS notifications to Slack and email
   - Real-time dashboard showing AZ health status

## Alternatives Considered

### 1. Single-AZ Deployment (Lower Cost)
**Pros:**
- 30-40% lower infrastructure costs
- Simpler network configuration
- Easier initial setup
- Lower NAT Gateway costs ($45/month vs. $135/month)

**Cons:**
- Single point of failure at AZ level
- Extended downtime during AZ outages (historical: hours to days)
- No automatic failover capability
- Unacceptable for trading platform requirements
- Competitive disadvantage vs. established platforms

**Rejected:** Risk of extended downtime unacceptable for trading operations

### 2. Active-Active Multi-Region Deployment
**Pros:**
- Maximum availability and disaster recovery
- Global performance optimization
- Protection against regional outages
- Industry best practice for critical systems

**Cons:**
- 3-4x infrastructure costs
- Complex data synchronization and consistency challenges
- Significantly higher operational complexity
- Cross-region latency for data replication
- Overkill for beta launch stage

**Rejected:** Cost and complexity not justified for current scale

### 3. Multi-AZ with Active-Passive Standby Region
**Pros:**
- Regional disaster recovery capability
- Lower cost than active-active
- Better than Multi-AZ alone for catastrophic failures

**Cons:**
- Still 2x cost of Multi-AZ only
- Manual failover to standby region
- Longer recovery time for regional disasters
- Additional operational complexity

**Deferred:** Considered for future post-beta expansion if growth justifies cost

### 4. Kubernetes (EKS) Multi-AZ Deployment
**Pros:**
- Industry-standard orchestration
- Advanced scheduling and auto-healing
- Rich ecosystem of tools

**Cons:**
- Significantly higher operational complexity
- Longer time to production (conflicts with September deadline)
- Steeper learning curve for team
- Higher costs ($73/month cluster fee + compute)

**Rejected:** Already decided on ECS over EKS (see ADR-300)

## Consequences

### Positive

**Availability Improvements:**
- **99.9%+ uptime achieved** during beta launch (October 17, 2025)
- Automatic failover for database and compute layers
- No single point of failure at infrastructure level
- Continued operation during AZ-level incidents

**Business Benefits:**
- Enhanced user trust and platform reliability
- Competitive positioning against established trading platforms
- Reduced risk of reputational damage during critical beta phase
- Ability to handle traffic spikes and failures gracefully

**Operational Benefits:**
- Automatic recovery reduces manual intervention
- Peace of mind during off-hours and weekends
- Simplified disaster recovery procedures
- Documented runbooks for failure scenarios

**Performance:**
- Load distribution across AZs improves resource utilization
- Lower latency for users in different geographic locations within region
- Better handling of traffic spikes

### Negative

**Cost Impact:**
- **~40-50% increase in infrastructure costs** compared to single-AZ
- Additional NAT Gateway costs: 3 gateways × $45/month = $135/month (vs. $45/month single-AZ)
- Cross-AZ data transfer costs (typically minimal for intra-region traffic)
- Additional ECS tasks for multi-AZ distribution
- Multi-AZ RDS pricing premium (~2x storage costs)

**Estimated Monthly Cost Increase:**
- Base single-AZ: ~$500/month
- Multi-AZ deployment: ~$750/month
- Increase: ~$250/month (~50% premium)
- **Justification:** $250/month for 99.9% uptime is excellent value for trading platform

**Operational Complexity:**
- More complex network configuration and troubleshooting
- Need to monitor AZ-level health and balance
- Slightly more complex deployment procedures
- Cross-AZ latency considerations (typically < 2ms)

**Development Impact:**
- Services must be designed to be stateless and AZ-agnostic
- Session data must be shared (via Redis) across AZs
- Database connection pools must account for failover scenarios
- Testing must include AZ failover scenarios

### Neutral

**Monitoring Requirements:**
- CloudWatch dashboards showing AZ-level metrics
- Alarms for AZ-level failures and imbalances
- Regular DR drills to verify failover procedures (quarterly)
- Documentation of failure scenarios and responses

**Data Considerations:**
- Multi-AZ RDS provides synchronous replication (no data loss on failover)
- S3 cross-region replication for catastrophic regional failure
- ClickHouse replication configuration for high availability
- Backup strategy remains largely unchanged
