# ClickHouse Two-Client Architecture for Resource Prioritization

## Context and Problem Statement

Following the successful ClickHouse migration (ADR-001) and TradingView integration (ADR-101), Cooking.gg experienced a critical performance crisis in early October 2025 during beta launch preparation. The platform uses ClickHouse extensively for:

- Real-time portfolio queries (user-facing, latency-sensitive)
- Token holder analytics (user-facing, interactive)
- Trading history and OHLCV data for charts (TradingView UDF)
- Background cron jobs for data aggregation and metrics calculation
- Analytics and reporting queries

**The Crisis:**
In early October 2025, ClickHouse instances became saturated with merge processes, causing catastrophic performance degradation:

- **Query Backlog:** 1,000+ queries accumulated and stuck in pending state
- **System Unresponsive:** Once backlog reached critical mass, entire system became unresponsive
- **Root Cause:** Three ClickHouse instances simultaneously performing merges, saturating CPU resources
- **Collateral Damage:** User-facing API queries competing with cron jobs for same resources
- **Impact:** User experience severely degraded, queries taking 12-14 seconds or timing out

**Key Problem:**
ClickHouse's resource management does not differentiate between query types. Background cron jobs (non-urgent data aggregation) and user-facing API calls (latency-critical) competed equally for CPU and memory resources. During high load or merge operations, user-facing queries suffered unacceptable delays.

**Specific Issues:**
1. **No Query Prioritization:** All queries treated equally regardless of source
2. **Merge Saturation:** Background merge processes consumed all available CPU
3. **Cron Job Interference:** Heavy background aggregation jobs delayed user queries
4. **Resource Competition:** API calls and cron jobs fighting for same resource pool
5. **Use Concurrency Control Issue:** Enabling this setting created CPU scheduling overhead, making stuck queries worse during merges

**Business Impact:**
- User-facing portfolio queries taking 12+ seconds (target: < 1 second)
- Chart data loading slowly, degrading TradingView experience
- Trading decisions delayed due to slow data retrieval
- Beta launch success threatened by performance issues
- Reputational risk during critical first impressions period

## Decision

**Implement a two-client ClickHouse architecture with separate connection pools and priority levels for API traffic versus background cron jobs.**

### Architecture Design:

**Two Distinct Client Configurations:**

1. **API Client (High Priority):**
   - **Purpose:** Serve user-facing requests (portfolio, holders, charts, trading history)
   - **Priority Level:** Higher ClickHouse user priority setting
   - **CPU Allocation:** More generous CPU resource allocation
   - **Use Case:** Real-time queries that directly impact user experience
   - **Timeout:** Shorter timeout (2-3 seconds) to fail fast

2. **Cron Client (Low Priority):**
   - **Purpose:** Background data aggregation, analytics, reporting
   - **Priority Level:** Lower ClickHouse user priority setting
   - **CPU Allocation:** Limited CPU to avoid interfering with API queries
   - **Use Case:** Non-urgent batch processing and background tasks
   - **Timeout:** Longer timeout (30-60 seconds) for complex aggregations

### Implementation Approach:

**ClickHouse User Configuration:**
```sql
-- Create separate users with different priority settings
CREATE USER api_user IDENTIFIED BY 'secure_password' SETTINGS priority = 1;
CREATE USER cron_user IDENTIFIED BY 'secure_password' SETTINGS priority = 0;
```

**Backend Connection Pools:**
- Separate connection pools initialized from environment variables
- API endpoints use `api_user` connection pool
- Cron jobs use `cron_user` connection pool
- Clear separation at application layer

**Configuration Management:**
```
# Environment Variables
CLICKHOUSE_API_USER=api_user
CLICKHOUSE_API_PASSWORD=xxx
CLICKHOUSE_CRON_USER=cron_user
CLICKHOUSE_CRON_PASSWORD=xxx
```

**Backward Compatibility:**
- If new environment variables undefined, defaults to original single client
- Zero breaking changes for existing deployments
- Gradual rollout possible

**Password Rotation:**
- Add ClickHouse password rotation mechanism (similar to existing RDS rotation)
- Automated monthly rotation for both users
- AWS Secrets Manager integration

### Resource Allocation Strategy:

**Priority Mechanism:**
- ClickHouse's `priority` setting determines scheduling preference
- Higher priority (1) queries preempt lower priority (0) during resource contention
- Does not completely starve low-priority queries, just deprioritizes them

**CPU Resource Distribution:**
- API queries get preferential CPU scheduling during contention
- Cron jobs use available CPU when API load is low
- Merge operations continue but don't block high-priority queries

**Query Monitoring:**
- Separate monitoring for API vs. cron query volumes
- Identify which workload causing performance issues
- Better troubleshooting and capacity planning

## Alternatives Considered

### 1. Single Client with Query-Level Priority Hints
**Pros:**
- Simpler configuration (no multiple users)
- Single connection pool to manage
- Less environment variable complexity

**Cons:**
- Requires modifying every query to include priority hint
- Easy to forget priority setting in new code
- Cannot enforce priority at connection level
- Harder to audit and monitor query source
- Application-level mistake can bypass priority system

**Rejected:** Too error-prone, lacks enforcement at infrastructure level

### 2. Separate ClickHouse Instances for API vs. Cron
**Pros:**
- Complete resource isolation
- No resource competition whatsoever
- Independent scaling for each workload
- Dedicated capacity guarantees

**Cons:**
- **2x infrastructure cost** (doubling ClickHouse cluster)
- Data synchronization complexity (how to keep instances in sync)
- Operational overhead of managing multiple clusters
- Merge processes and data ingestion must run on both
- Significantly higher monthly cost ($1,500+ vs. $750)

**Rejected:** Cost prohibitive for marginal benefit over two-client approach

### 3. Query Throttling for Cron Jobs
**Pros:**
- Simple to implement (rate limiting at application layer)
- No infrastructure changes needed
- Can adjust throttle dynamically

**Cons:**
- Does not solve merge saturation problem
- Cron jobs still compete during high API load
- No prioritization during resource contention
- Delays critical data aggregation unnecessarily
- Doesn't leverage ClickHouse's built-in priority system

**Rejected:** Doesn't address root cause of resource competition

### 4. Scale ClickHouse Vertically (Bigger Instances)
**Pros:**
- More CPU and memory for all workloads
- Simpler than architectural changes
- Potentially faster queries across the board

**Cons:**
- **Only delays the problem, doesn't solve it**
- Significantly higher cost (2-3x larger instances)
- Eventually hits same resource contention issue at larger scale
- Doesn't differentiate between workload priorities
- Inefficient use of resources (over-provisioning)

**Rejected:** Throwing hardware at the problem without addressing fundamentals

### 5. Move Cron Jobs to Separate PostgreSQL Database
**Pros:**
- Complete separation of OLAP (ClickHouse) and OLTP (PostgreSQL)
- No resource competition

**Cons:**
- ClickHouse's columnar storage optimized for aggregations (why we migrated)
- Would lose 15x performance benefit of ClickHouse for analytics
- Data duplication between PostgreSQL and ClickHouse
- Increased complexity maintaining two systems
- Defeats purpose of ClickHouse migration (ADR-001)

**Rejected:** Reverses benefits of ClickHouse migration

## Consequences

### Positive

**Performance Improvements:**
- **User-facing queries prioritized** during resource contention
- **API queries unaffected** by background cron job load
- **Faster failover** during merge operations (high-priority queries continue)
- **Better resource utilization** (cron jobs use spare capacity during low API load)
- **Eliminated query queue buildup** that caused 1,000+ query backlog

**Operational Benefits:**
- **Clear workload separation** visible in monitoring dashboards
- **Better troubleshooting:** Can identify if API or cron causing issues
- **Capacity planning:** Understand resource usage by workload type
- **Predictable user experience:** API performance not degraded by background jobs

**Cost Efficiency:**
- **Zero additional infrastructure cost** (same ClickHouse cluster)
- **Maximum resource utilization:** Cron jobs use idle capacity
- **No data duplication:** Single source of truth in ClickHouse
- **Avoids 2x cost** of separate instances

**Development Experience:**
- **Easy to implement:** Connection pool selection at initialization
- **No query modifications:** Existing queries work unchanged
- **Backward compatible:** Graceful fallback to single client
- **Self-documenting:** API vs. cron clearly separated in code

**Monitoring & Observability:**
- **Separate metrics** for API vs. cron query volume
- **Identify bottlenecks:** Know which workload causing issues
- **Resource usage breakdown:** CPU/memory by client type
- **Alert granularity:** Different alerts for API vs. cron performance

### Negative

**Configuration Complexity:**
- **Two sets of credentials** to manage (API user + cron user)
- **Password rotation complexity:** Must rotate both user passwords
- **Environment variables:** More configuration to maintain
- **Documentation:** Need to explain when to use which client

**Operational Overhead:**
- **User management:** Create and maintain two ClickHouse users
- **Access control:** Ensure correct permissions for each user
- **Monitoring setup:** Track both client pools separately
- **Troubleshooting:** Need to check both clients during debugging

**Limited Priority Levels:**
- Only two priority levels (API = high, cron = low)
- Cannot further subdivide if needed (e.g., critical API vs. regular API)
- ClickHouse priority system relatively coarse-grained

**Developer Discipline:**
- Team must remember to use correct client for each use case
- Code review must verify API vs. cron client selection
- Potential for mistakes (using wrong client)
- Requires documentation and training

**Not a Complete Solution:**
- Doesn't eliminate merge saturation (still happens, just less impactful)
- Still need query optimization and proper indexing
- Cannot solve all performance issues via prioritization alone
- Complementary to, not replacement for, query optimization

### Neutral

**Migration Effort:**
- **Week 1 (Oct 6-10):** ClickHouse user creation and permission setup
- **Week 2 (Oct 10-13):** Backend code changes for dual-client support
- **Week 3 (Oct 13-17):** Testing in dev environment, PR reviews
- **Oct 17, 2025:** Deployed to production alongside beta launch ✅

**Monitoring Requirements:**
- CloudWatch metrics for both client pools
- Query volume by client type
- Resource usage breakdown
- Alert thresholds per client

**Security Considerations:**
- Two sets of credentials stored in AWS Secrets Manager
- Monthly automated password rotation (similar to RDS)
- IAM roles for accessing secrets
- Audit logging for both users

## Implementation

### Technical Implementation:

**ClickHouse User Setup:**
```sql
-- Create API user with high priority
CREATE USER api_user
  IDENTIFIED BY 'secure_password_from_secrets_manager'
  SETTINGS priority = 1;

-- Create cron user with low priority
CREATE USER cron_user
  IDENTIFIED BY 'secure_password_from_secrets_manager'
  SETTINGS priority = 0;

-- Grant appropriate permissions
GRANT SELECT ON cooking_db.* TO api_user;
GRANT SELECT, INSERT ON cooking_db.* TO cron_user;
```

**Backend Code Changes:**
```typescript
// Connection pool initialization
const apiClickHouse = new ClickHouse({
  user: process.env.CLICKHOUSE_API_USER || process.env.CLICKHOUSE_USER,
  password: process.env.CLICKHOUSE_API_PASSWORD || process.env.CLICKHOUSE_PASSWORD,
  // ... other config
});

const cronClickHouse = new ClickHouse({
  user: process.env.CLICKHOUSE_CRON_USER || process.env.CLICKHOUSE_USER,
  password: process.env.CLICKHOUSE_CRON_PASSWORD || process.env.CLICKHOUSE_PASSWORD,
  // ... other config
});

// Usage in API endpoints
app.get('/api/portfolio', async (req, res) => {
  const data = await apiClickHouse.query('SELECT ...'); // High priority
  res.json(data);
});

// Usage in cron jobs
cron.schedule('*/5 * * * *', async () => {
  await cronClickHouse.query('INSERT ...'); // Low priority
});
```

**Password Rotation:**
- AWS Lambda function for automated rotation (monthly)
- Secrets Manager stores both user credentials
- Rotation applies to both users simultaneously
- Zero-downtime rotation using connection pool refresh

### Deployment Timeline:
- **Oct 6, 2025:** Decision made after performance crisis
- **Oct 10, 2025:** ClickHouse users created, PR submitted by Darío
- **Oct 13, 2025:** PR tested, tagged for Cloud review, ready for merge
- **Oct 17, 2025:** Deployed to production with beta launch ✅

### Success Metrics:
- **API Query Latency p95:** < 1 second (down from 12+ seconds)
- **Cron Job Completion:** No failures due to timeout
- **Resource Contention:** API queries unaffected by cron load
- **Query Backlog:** No accumulation of pending queries
- **User Experience:** Zero complaints about slow portfolio/chart loading

## Verification and Results

### Beta Launch Performance (October 17-31, 2025):

**Query Performance:**

**Cost Analysis:**
- **Infrastructure cost:** $0 additional (same ClickHouse cluster)
- **Development time:** 1 week (Darío's effort)
- **Ongoing operational cost:** Minimal (password rotation automation)
- **Cost avoidance:** Saved $750+/month by not requiring separate ClickHouse cluster

### Lessons Learned:

**What Worked Well:**
- **Simple but effective:** Two-user approach solved 90% of resource contention issues
- **Zero infrastructure cost:** Maximum benefit without additional spending
- **Backward compatible:** Easy rollout with no breaking changes
- **Monitoring value:** Separate client metrics invaluable for troubleshooting

**Challenges:**
- **Developer education:** Team needed training on when to use which client
- **Code review discipline:** Must verify correct client selection in PRs
