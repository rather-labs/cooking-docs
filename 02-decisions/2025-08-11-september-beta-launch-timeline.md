# ADR-203: September Beta Launch Timeline

**Note:** Original target was September 2025, later revised to October 17, 2025 for final launch.

## Context

During the critical Project Alignment meeting on August 11, 2025, following the Hyperliquid integration crisis and client concerns about timeline management, the team needed to establish a concrete beta launch deadline. The project had been in development for several months with a growing team and expanding scope, but lacked specific target dates that the client could rely on for planning partnerships, marketing, and business development activities.

### Background

**Project Timeline:**
- Development began May 2025
- Team grew from ~5 to 11+ members by August
- Multiple architectural decisions and pivots (ClickHouse, Hyperliquid, Auth0, etc.)
- Client relationship strained by Hyperliquid geolocation issue
- "Gray area" problem: Unclear definitions of "beta," "V1," "V2"

**Business Context:**
- **Katana Exclusivity Agreement**: Cooking.gg has exclusive deal to launch first gamified launchpad on Katana network
- **Previous Product Launch Failed**: Pressure to succeed with new product
- **Partnership Conversations Waiting**: Need live product to demonstrate to potential partners
- **Marketing Planning**: Can't start light marketing without launch date
- **Community Building**: Goal to build "cult community" requires concrete timeline

**Client Concerns (Zen):**
From Project Alignment meeting:
> "Long marathon build (several months). Gets gray when it comes to 'beta launch,' 'V1,' 'V2.' Need more concrete timelines."

> "Super Important: Beta in September. Not an MVP - an actual product people can use day-to-day."

**Development Status (Early August):**
- Core trading functionality complete
- Auth0 social authentication integrated
- ClickHouse migration delivering 15x performance improvement
- Hyperliquid perpetuals integration underway (facing challenges)
- Mobile app development in progress (Apple review timing uncertain)
- System stability: 99.9% uptime, handling 100+ concurrent users
- Transaction speed: 5-6 seconds (target: sub-3 seconds)

**Remaining Work Estimation:**
- UI/UX polish and refinement
- Mobile app completion and Apple review
- Testing and bug fixing
- Feature freeze for stability
- Onboarding flow completion
- Marketing site requirements
- Beta user management system

### Problem Statement

The team needed to answer critical questions:

1. **When will beta launch?** Specific date, not "soon" or "Q3"
2. **What is beta?** Not an MVP, but actual usable product - what does that mean exactly?
3. **What's in scope?** What features will be included vs. deferred to post-beta?
4. **What's the plan?** How will features prioritized and timeline managed?
5. **How do we avoid slips?** What buffer and contingency exists?

**Client Requirements:**
- Concrete timeline for external planning and communication
- Beta that users can "use day-to-day" (not experimental MVP)
- Ability to start light marketing and partner conversations
- Foundation for building cult community
- Platform to gather feedback for V1 planning

**Team Constraints:**
- 5 weeks from August 11 to end of September
- Mobile app dependent on Apple review (unpredictable timing)
- Three features already deferred to Q4 (multi-language, portfolio TP/SL, market cap variation)
- Need to maintain quality and stability (no rushed release)
- Recent client relationship strain requiring trust rebuilding

---

## Decision

**Commit to September 2025 beta launch with actual usable product (not MVP), enabling daily use, feedback gathering, light marketing, and community building.**

**Note:** This decision was later revised to **October 17, 2025** actual launch date, with internal target of Wednesday, October 15, 2025, to avoid weekend on-call crisis management if issues emerged from Friday launch.

### Timeline Structure

**Initial Target (Established August 11):**
- **Beta Launch:** End of September 2025
- **Development Timeline:** ~5 weeks from decision date
- **Beta Nature:** Actual product people can use day-to-day, not MVP
- **Access Model:** Referral-only closed beta (per ADR-201)

**Revised Timeline (Established October 13):**
- **Internal Target:** Wednesday, October 15, 2025
- **Official Launch:** Friday, October 17, 2025
- **Rationale:** Wednesday internal deadline avoids weekend on-call work if Friday launch has issues
- **Actual Launch:** October 17, 2025 (successfully executed)

**Phased Rollout:**
- **Phase 1 (Oct 20):** Internal testing with 5 initial users
- **Phase 2 (Oct 27):** Closed beta with 30-40 whitelist users (if no critical issues found)
- **Phase 3 (TBD):** Gradual expansion via referral codes

### Beta Definition

**What Beta IS:**
- Actual product users can operate day-to-day
- Core trading functionality complete and stable
- Social authentication (Twitter, Google, Apple) working
- Wallet operations functional
- Real-time data and charts operational
- Mobile app available (pending Apple review)
- Referral program activated
- 99.9%+ uptime target
- Transaction completion under 3 seconds (achieved)

**What Beta is NOT:**
- Full feature parity with V1 vision
- All advanced features complete
- Perfect UI/UX polish (good enough for feedback)
- Open to everyone (referral-only access)
- Final pricing/fee structure (may evolve)

**Purpose of Beta:**
1. Get user feedback on core functionality
2. Start light marketing and buzz generation
3. Begin building cult community
4. Speak with partners using live product
5. Validate product-market fit
6. Gather data for V1 feature prioritization
7. Stress test infrastructure at scale

### Scope Management

**Deferred to Q4 (Post-Beta):**
From Project Alignment meeting, agreed with "Gre" (Greg) last Friday before meeting:
1. Multi-language support
2. Portfolio-wide Take Profit/Stop Loss
3. Market Cap Variation Algorithm

**Mobile App Caveat:**
- Cannot guarantee mobile availability by end September due to Apple App Store review process
- Web platform will launch regardless
- Mobile follows as soon as Apple approves

**Feature Freeze:**
- Stability over new features in final weeks before launch
- Focus on polish, testing, bug fixing
- No scope expansion after commitment made

---

## Rationale

### Primary Drivers

**1. Client Relationship Rebuilding**

The Project Alignment meeting occurred during a strained period following the Hyperliquid geolocation issue. Zen expressed disappointment:

> "Disappointing and concerning personally to Zen. We do kind of trust you guys to make sure execution of things has less potholes. Things need to change accordingly after this. Need to be improving after this for sure."

**Concrete Timeline Benefits:**
- Demonstrates accountability and commitment
- Provides measurable milestone for trust rebuilding
- Shows responsiveness to client feedback about "gray area" problem
- Enables client to plan external activities (partnerships, marketing)

**From Lucas:**
> "I am 100% on your side, man. I want to be super clear on that. That is why I wanted to discuss this with you over call through messages."

Committing to September beta was part of transparency and accountability response.

**2. Business Enablement**

**Katana Exclusivity Pressure:**
- First to launch gamified launchpad on Katana network
- Previous product launch failed
- Katana "appears to be applying pressure"
- Exclusivity value diminishes if competitors launch first

**Partnership Requirements:**
From Zen:
> "Purpose: Get people's feedback. Start very light marketing. Start to build cult community. Speak to partners."

> "As it's live, can add additional features to it."

Cannot execute on business objectives without live platform and concrete timeline.

**3. End of "Gray Area" Problem**

**Client Frustration:**
> "Long marathon build (several months). Gets gray when it comes to 'beta launch,' 'V1,' 'V2.' Need more concrete timelines."

**Solution:**
- Specific month: September 2025
- Clear definition: "Not an MVP - an actual product people can use day-to-day"
- Documented scope: What's in vs. what's deferred
- Phased approach: Beta → V1 → V2 with time allocations

**4. Team Focus and Prioritization**

**Before Decision:**
- Expanding scope, unclear priorities
- Features added without clear timeline impact assessment
- "Gray" about what constitutes done

**After Decision:**
- Clear deadline drives prioritization decisions
- Feature freeze becomes justified and necessary
- Team aligned on "good enough" vs. "perfect" trade-offs
- Bug fixing and stability prioritized over new features

**5. September Feasibility**

**Development Status Assessment (August 11):**
- **5 weeks available** (August 11 → September 30)
- Core functionality complete (trading, auth, wallets, charts)
- Major architectural decisions made and implemented
- Infrastructure stable (99.9% uptime)
- Team size adequate (11+ members)
- Known scope (deferred features identified)

**Remaining Work Achievable:**
- UI/UX polish (weeks, not months)
- Bug fixing and testing (continuous process)
- Onboarding flow (straightforward implementation)
- Beta user management (referral system already designed)
- Marketing site (can be minimal for beta)

**Risks Acknowledged:**
- Mobile app timing uncertain (Apple review)
- Unknown unknowns (bugs, issues discovered during testing)
- Quality vs. speed trade-offs

**Mitigation:**
- Mobile not blocker for beta launch (web sufficient)
- Feature freeze provides buffer for unknowns
- "Actual product" not "perfect product" - good enough to be useful
- Phased rollout allows fixing issues before scale

**6. Market Timing and Momentum**

**Competitive Landscape:**
- Other platforms offering similar functionality
- First-mover advantage in specific niche (gamified launchpad on Katana)
- Crypto market cycles - timing matters for user adoption

**Momentum Factors:**
- Team morale benefits from clear target
- Client relationship benefits from delivery
- Partnership conversations benefit from live product
- Marketing benefits from concrete launch date for promotion

Delaying to Q4 or beyond risks:
- Losing Katana exclusivity value
- Competitive products launching first
- Team morale impact from indefinite timeline
- Client relationship further strain

---

## Alternatives Considered

### 1. August 2025 Launch (Immediate)

**Description:** Accelerate timeline to launch within 2-3 weeks.

**Advantages:**
- Fastest time to market
- Immediate business enablement
- Maximum competitive advantage timing

**Disadvantages:**
- ❌ Insufficient time for quality polish
- ❌ Risks launching with critical bugs
- ❌ Mobile app definitely not ready
- ❌ Insufficient testing and stability validation
- ❌ Team burnout from rush
- ❌ Client already concerned about quality - rushing worsens perception

**Why Rejected:** Too aggressive given recent quality concerns from client. Would undermine trust rebuilding objective.

### 2. End of Q3 2025 (September) - CHOSEN

**Description:** 5-week timeline to launch functional beta by end of September.

**Advantages:**
- ✅ Achievable with feature freeze
- ✅ Provides buffer for polish and testing
- ✅ Meets client need for "concrete timeline"
- ✅ Enables Q4 planning for V1
- ✅ Reasonable timeline for team (not rushed, not indefinite)

**Disadvantages:**
- ⚠️ Mobile app timing uncertain (Apple review)
- ⚠️ Compressed timeline for comprehensive testing
- ⚠️ Some features deferred to post-beta

**Why Chosen:** Best balance of achievability, quality, and business needs. (Later revised to October 17 for additional polish time.)

### 3. Q4 2025 (October-December)

**Description:** More conservative 8-12 week timeline for comprehensive polish.

**Advantages:**
- More time for testing and quality assurance
- Higher confidence in mobile app availability
- Reduced risk of critical issues at launch
- More complete feature set possible

**Disadvantages:**
- ❌ Delays business enablement (partnerships, marketing)
- ❌ Katana exclusivity value diminishes
- ❌ Competitive timing risk
- ❌ Team morale impact from extended timeline
- ❌ Client specifically requested "September beta"
- ❌ Doesn't address "gray area" problem - still vague timeline

**Why Rejected:** Doesn't meet client's explicit request for September beta. Risk of scope creep and perfectionism delaying indefinitely.

**Note:** Team ultimately took extra 2.5 weeks (October 17 actual launch), achieving benefits of this alternative while maintaining commitment to concrete timeline.

### 4. Phased Milestones (No Single Beta Date)

**Description:** Series of milestone releases instead of one "beta launch."

**Example Structure:**
- Milestone 1 (Late August): Core trading functional
- Milestone 2 (Mid September): Authentication and wallets complete
- Milestone 3 (End September): Full beta feature set
- Milestone 4 (October): Mobile launch

**Advantages:**
- Reduces pressure of single launch date
- Allows iterative validation and feedback
- Flexibility to adjust timeline per milestone
- Continuous delivery approach

**Disadvantages:**
- ❌ Doesn't provide "concrete timeline" client requested
- ❌ Difficult to communicate externally (which milestone is "launch"?)
- ❌ Perpetuates "gray area" problem
- ❌ Partnerships and marketing need single reference point
- ❌ Media and community need clear launch announcement

**Why Rejected:** Doesn't solve fundamental problem of needing concrete date for external communication and planning.

### 5. "When It's Ready" (No Commitment)

**Description:** Continue development without specific deadline, launch when quality threshold met.

**Advantages:**
- Maximum quality assurance
- No pressure to cut corners
- Flexibility to address issues as discovered
- Common in software: "ship when ready"

**Disadvantages:**
- ❌ Client explicitly rejected this approach ("need concrete timelines")
- ❌ Enables indefinite scope creep
- ❌ Difficult to make business decisions (partnerships, marketing, hiring)
- ❌ Team lacks clear target for focus
- ❌ Recent client concerns make open-ended timeline unacceptable
- ❌ "Gray area" problem persists

**Why Rejected:** Directly contradicts client's explicit request and doesn't address relationship strain from Hyperliquid issue.

## Consequences

### Positive Outcomes

**Client Relationship:**
- ✅ Rebuilt trust through concrete commitment
- ✅ Addressed "gray area" problem with specific date
- ✅ Enabled weekly sprint calls for ongoing alignment (new process established)
- ✅ Demonstrated accountability and responsiveness

**Business Enablement:**
- ✅ Partnership conversations could reference specific launch date
- ✅ Marketing planning could begin with concrete timeline
- ✅ Community building could start with launch anticipation
- ✅ Katana exclusivity value preserved

**Team Dynamics:**
- ✅ Clear target focused priorities and effort
- ✅ Feature freeze became justified and enforceable
- ✅ "Good enough for beta" threshold empowered decisions
- ✅ Milestone celebration opportunity (morale boost)

**Product Development:**
- ✅ Forced prioritization of essential features
- ✅ Deferred features documented and planned for Q4
- ✅ Quality threshold defined ("actual product people can use day-to-day")
- ✅ Testing and stability prioritized over feature expansion

**Actual Results (October 17, 2025):**
- ✅ Beta launched successfully (2.5 weeks later than original target)
- ✅ Transaction completion: 3 seconds (down from 5-6 seconds) - **exceeded goal**
- ✅ System stability: 99.9% uptime - **met target**
- ✅ ClickHouse performance: 15x improvement - **validated**
- ✅ Phased rollout: 5 users (Oct 20) → 30-40 users (Oct 27) - **controlled growth**
- ✅ Client satisfaction: "Impressed and satisfied" per meeting notes

### Negative Consequences

**Timeline Pressure:**
- ⚠️ 5-week timeline created stress and compressed testing
- ⚠️ Feature freeze required deferring desired functionality
- ⚠️ Mobile app exclusion from beta (Apple review timing)
- ⚠️ UI/UX polish limited (functional but not perfect)

**Mitigation:**
- Team ultimately took 2.5 additional weeks (October 17 launch)
- Internal Wednesday target provided buffer before Friday official launch
- Phased rollout (5 users first) allowed issue detection before scale
- "Actual product" not "perfect product" managed expectations

**Scope Constraints:**
- ⚠️ Three features deferred to Q4 (multi-language, portfolio TP/SL, market cap variation)
- ⚠️ Some advanced features incomplete (limit orders refinement, advanced algorithms)
- ⚠️ Mobile app launch dependent on Apple review (out of team control)

**Mitigation:**
- Deferred features documented and communicated to client
- Q4 timeline established for deferred features
- Beta explicitly positioned as not complete feature set
- "As it's live, can add additional features" - iterative approach

**Risk of Slippage:**
- ⚠️ Concrete deadline creates risk of missing publicly committed date
- ⚠️ Unknown unknowns (critical bugs, infrastructure issues) could force delay
- ⚠️ Apple review could delay mobile indefinitely

**Actual Outcome:**
- Timeline did slip 2.5 weeks (September → October 17)
- But: Positioned as internal refinement, not failure
- Client satisfied with October 17 launch quality
- Delay resulted in better product (3s transactions vs. 5-6s)

**Team Burnout Risk:**
- ⚠️ Compressed timeline risks team exhaustion
- ⚠️ Quality pressure combined with speed pressure
- ⚠️ Weekend work and extended hours

**Mitigation:**
- Feature freeze reduced scope pressure
- Phased rollout reduced launch day pressure
- Wednesday internal target avoided weekend crisis work
- Team size (11+ members) distributed workload

### Trade-offs Accepted

**Scope vs. Timeline:**
- Accepted: Deferred features to Q4
- Rationale: Concrete timeline more valuable than complete feature set for beta objectives

**Quality vs. Speed:**
- Accepted: "Actual product" not "perfect product"
- Rationale: Iterative approach allows post-launch improvement, beta specifically for feedback

**Certainty vs. Flexibility:**
- Accepted: Committed to date despite unknowns
- Rationale: Client relationship and business needs require concrete commitment despite risk

**Mobile vs. Web:**
- Accepted: Web-first launch, mobile follows when Apple approves
- Rationale: Web platform sufficient for beta objectives, mobile timing out of control

## Notes

### Strategic Context

This decision was made at a critical inflection point:

**Before (Strained Relationship):**
- Client disappointed about Hyperliquid geolocation oversight
- Trust impacted ("we do kind of trust you guys...")
- Comparison to other teams (smaller budget, faster results)
- Vague timelines and "gray area" frustration

**After (Rebuilt Relationship):**
- Concrete commitment and accountability demonstrated
- Weekly sprint calls established for ongoing alignment
- Transparent communication about scope and timeline
- Successful delivery on commitment (even if 2.5 weeks later)

The September beta timeline decision was as much about relationship management as project management.

### Timeline Evolution

**Committed:** End of September 2025
**Internal Target:** Wednesday, October 15, 2025
**Official Launch:** Friday, October 17, 2025
**Actual Launch:** Friday, October 17, 2025 ✅

**Delay Analysis:**
The 2.5-week slip from September to October 17 was:
- Communicated and managed (not surprise)
- Resulted in better product (3s transactions vs. 5-6s)
- Client satisfied with quality outcome
- Positioned as refinement, not failure

**Key Lesson:** Concrete timeline valuable even if adjusted, vs. open-ended "when ready" approach that perpetuates gray area problem.

### Quality vs. Timeline Trade-off

The team ultimately chose quality over hitting original September deadline:
- Extra 2.5 weeks allowed transaction speed optimization (3s vs. 5-6s)
- ClickHouse performance validated and optimized
- More comprehensive testing completed
- Client "impressed and satisfied" with result

This demonstrates healthy prioritization: concrete timelines drive focus, but quality gates prevent premature launch.

### Phased Rollout Wisdom

**October 17:** Official launch
**October 20:** Phase 1 - 5 users (3-day buffer)
**October 27:** Phase 2 - 30-40 users (10-day validation)

This conservative rollout:
- Validates system under real load before scale
- Provides time to fix issues discovered by first 5 users
- Reduces risk of widespread critical issues
- Aligns with "actual product" requirement (must work reliably)

### Client Relationship Outcomes

**From strained to satisfied in 2.5 months:**
- August 11: Disappointment and concern expressed
- August-October: Weekly sprint calls, transparent communication
- October 17: "Client impressed and satisfied"

The concrete timeline commitment was turning point in relationship recovery, demonstrating that sometimes accountability and commitment matter more than perfect execution.

### Lessons for Future Milestones

**What Worked:**
1. Concrete timeline despite uncertainty
2. Clear scope definition (in vs. out)
3. Feature freeze to protect timeline
4. Phased rollout to reduce risk
5. Internal buffer before official deadline (Wednesday → Friday)
6. Weekly alignment calls for ongoing communication

**What to Repeat:**
1. Commit to concrete dates for business planning
2. Define quality threshold ("actual product" not "perfect product")
3. Document deferred features transparently
4. Build in buffers (internal vs. external deadlines)
5. Phased rollout for controlled validation
6. Regular alignment touchpoints with stakeholders
