# Turnkey for Wallet Management and Key Signing

## Context and Problem Statement

Cooking.gg is a trading platform that requires secure wallet management and transaction signing for both Solana and Hyperliquid (EVM) trading. The platform targets "normie" users who may not have existing crypto wallets or deep understanding of blockchain security. This creates several critical challenges:

**Security Requirements:**
- Private keys must never be exposed to client applications or servers
- Transaction signing must be secure and compliant with industry standards
- Users need seamless wallet creation without managing seed phrases
- Mobile apps require hardware-backed security (Secure Enclave/KeyStore)
- Multi-chain support (Solana + EVM for Hyperliquid perpetuals)

**User Experience Challenges:**
- Traditional wallet management (seed phrases, private keys) creates friction for normie users
- Social login (Google, Twitter, Apple, Telegram) must integrate with wallet creation
- Users expect "just works" experience without crypto complexity
- Account recovery must be possible without seed phrase backup

**Technical Constraints:**
- Small development team with limited time to September 2025 beta launch
- Cannot build secure key management infrastructure in-house (security risk + time)
- Must comply with mobile platform security requirements (iOS App Store, Google Play)
- Need to support both web and mobile platforms with consistent security

**Regulatory Considerations:**
- Users own their wallets (non-custodial approach preferred)
- Platform should not have access to user private keys
- Compliance with financial regulations for trading platforms
- Audit trail for all signing operations

## Decision

**Adopt Turnkey as the primary wallet management and key signing service for all user wallets on Cooking.gg.**

### Implementation Scope:

**Core Capabilities:**
1. **Wallet Creation:** Automatic wallet generation for new users upon registration
2. **Key Management:** Secure storage of private keys using Turnkey's infrastructure
3. **Transaction Signing:** Signing service for Solana and Hyperliquid (EVM) transactions
4. **Social Authentication Integration:** Works seamlessly with Auth0 social login (ADR-102)
5. **Multi-Chain Support:** Unified service for both Solana and EVM chains

**Architecture:**
```
User (Web/Mobile)
    ↓
Auth0 Social Login (ADR-102)
    ↓
Cooking Backend API
    ↓
Turnkey API
    ↓
Secure Enclave (Key Storage)
```

**Security Model:**
- Private keys stored in Turnkey's secure enclaves (never exposed)
- Transaction signing happens server-side via Turnkey API
- User authentication via Auth0 triggers Turnkey operations
- Security password (ADR-400) required for wallet operations
- Biometric authentication on mobile (ADR-401) adds additional layer

**Integration Points:**
- **Registration Flow:** Auth0 callback triggers Turnkey wallet creation
- **Trading Operations:** Backend requests Turnkey to sign transactions
- **Hyperliquid Integration:** Turnkey signs EVM transactions for perpetuals
- **Solana Trading:** Turnkey signs Solana transactions for meme coin trades
- **Mobile Apps:** Turnkey SDK with hardware-backed key protection
